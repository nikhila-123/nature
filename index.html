                    <h2>NATURE IS SPEAKING</h2>
                      <p>Nature Is Speaking is Conservation International’s invitation to the human race to listen to nature.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Nature is essential to every aspect of human life and well-being — we want to make sure it’s included in the conversation. People are taking more from nature than it has to give, and as a result, we’re putting our own lives on the line.

                        Nature’s message to humanity is simple: Nature doesn’t need people. People need nature.      
                      </p>
                      <p>We are not about us vs. them. It doesn’t matter if you’re an American, a Canadian, or a Papua New Guinean. You don’t even have to be particularly fond of the ocean or have a soft spot for elephants.
                        This is simply about all of us coming together to do what needs to be done. Because if we don’t, nature will continue to evolve. Without us. Here’s to the future. With humans.
                      </p>

                    <h2>OUR HUMANIFESTO</h2>
                      <p>Human beings are part of nature. Nature is not dependent on human beings to exist. Human beings, on the other hand, are totally dependent on nature to exist.  
                      </p>
                      <p>The growing number of people on the planet and how we live here is going to determine the future of nature. And the future of us. Nature will go on, no matter what. It will evolve. The question is, will it be with us or without us?

                        If nature could talk, it would probably say it doesn’t much matter ​either way. We must understand there are aspects of how our planet evolves that are totally out of our control. But there are things that we can manage, control and do responsibly that will allow us and the planet to evolve together.    
                      </p>
                      <p>We are Conservation International and we need your help. Our movement is dedicated to managing those we can control. Better. Country by country. Business by business. Human by human.

                <p>Nature is the mother of all, as it helps to sustain our life. It is our companion since eternity. Despite the importance of nature in human life, we are spoiling its balance only due to our greediness. Millions of years ago, when the knowledge of man was not better than an animal. At that time man used to get all the things needed for life only from nature. Even today, at the heights of science, our requirements are met by nature only. Nature is a boon given to us, as it protects crores and crores of organisms living on the earth. It gives us forests which are the lungs of Earth.
                </p>
                <p>Our lives as human beings started on this planet Earth and since then we are exhausting its resources. But, in return, we are exposing it to the external threats of destruction and mistreatment. Due to this, beautiful forests have been destroyed, rivers have been polluted and vast open lands have been consumed for buildings and factories. We are giving challenges to nature by doing activities as hunting down animals, cutting down trees, releasing poisonous gases and polluting rivers.
